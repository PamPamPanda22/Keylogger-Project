# Keylogger-Project

Description

A keylogger is a tool designed to record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. It can be either software-based, running silently in the background, or hardware-based, physically attached to the keyboard or device. Keyloggers are used for both legitimate purposes, such as parental control, employee monitoring, and IT troubleshooting, as well as malicious activities, including cyber espionage and identity theft. They can capture sensitive information like passwords and personal data. Effective detection and prevention measures include using antivirus software, firewalls, regular system updates, and maintaining physical security of devices.
